# nmap csgo (Game Config Script for CS:GO)
06/03/2021 patch

This is a config file I use to quickly set up CS:GO/CS2 on new PCs or after clean installs.  
It boosts FPS, optimizes the HUD, and improves competitive visibility.

Features:
- Net graph display and positioning
- Optimized viewmodel and HUD layout
- Bunnyhop-friendly movement
- Weapon and utility autobuy binds
- Preloads maps for faster load times
- Damage output toggle with F5


Installation:
Copy and paste the code below into your `autoexec.cfg`;
Open Steam's Launch Options and add +exec autoexec.cfg;
Also add -novid -tickrate 128 +mat_queue_mode 2 +cl_forcepreload 1 -novid -nojoy (optional)
